PREFATORY NOTE

Tffls edition differs from the earlier edition in the fol-
lowing respects: long quantities are marked throughout
the text; the notes have been entirely rewritten; and a
vocabulary has been added. The text follows that of
Jordan (Berlin, 1876) with a few slight changes to secure
a consistent orthography.

In the illness of Professor Greenough‚ Professor F. H.
Howard of Hamilton, N. Y.‚ has read th'e proof sheets and
has made valuable suggestions, for which Professor Green-

ough wishes personally to express his obligation.
